# Initiate app in local environment
1. cd next-strapi-app-peliculas (NEXT Client) 
2. npm install 
3. npm run dev (to start the client in development) 

# cd ..
# cd next-app-pel-backend/next-strapi-app-peliculas (STRAPI Server)
4. For using Strapi its needed an even version of node.js (example ^18.19.0) [If you are using Windows you can install a node version using nvm 'nvm list available; nvm install 18.19.0; nvm use 18.19.0 (to use the new version 18.19.0 in current path folder, or 'nvm alias default 18.19.0' to select the new version as the default)'] 
5. Then run npm install in cd next-app-pel-backend/next-strapi-app-peliculas and modify the env files with the next values with your cloudinary cloud-name (create one if don't have one): 
```
CLOUDINARY_NAME=""
CLOUDINARY_KEY=""
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=""
```
6. Then use npm run develop to start the server, and that's all 
```
Next client will be running in localhost:3000
Strapi backend will be running in localhost:1337
```
```
You can test calling localhost:1337/api/peliculas?filters[enlaceUrl][$eq]=the-terminator , to get the data for The terminator movie i.e. or 
localhost:1337/api/peliculas?populate=* to get all the movies in the Strapi database with images and relations 
```
